## Restart Point Strategy

- Run the model 60 years to get rid of the initial population
- But it makes the simulation longer runs
- After 60 years, choose the simulation closest to the targets
- For each scenario
  - Run 5 years to add randomness (60 to 65)
  - Turn on PrEP and Partner services (65 to 70)
  - Start the intervention (70 to 80)
- Only 20 years to simulate instead of 75 each run
- Still 10 years of "shuffling" before the scenarios (enough to go back to a "random state")
